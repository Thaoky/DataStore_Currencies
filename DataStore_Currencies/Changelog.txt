Version 2024.07.28 (28/07/2024)

- Fixes for The War Within
- Preparation work is done to support the transfer of currencies, but Blizzard is once again not consistently returning the values we need.
The transfer is based on C_CurrencyInfo.FetchCurrencyTransferTransactions, which is supposed to provide the GUID's of the characters involved in the transfer.
These GUID's are nil.. so until Blizzard fixes this, the code will remain commented.
